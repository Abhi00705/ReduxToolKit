To-Do List Application with Redux Toolkit

This project is a To-Do list application built using Redux Toolkit for state management. Users can add new To-Dos, and the application displays a list of them.

Key Features:

Add To-Dos: Users can enter text in an input field and click a button to add a new To-Do to the list.
List Management: The application displays a list of all To-Dos. (Optional: You can extend this to include features like filtering, searching, or marking To-Dos as complete.)
Technologies Used:

Redux Toolkit: A simplified approach to Redux for managing application state.
React (assumed): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Potential Enhancements:

Persistence: Store To-Dos in local storage or a server to persist data between sessions.
Filtering/Searching: Allow users to filter the To-Do list based on various criteria.
Completion Status: Add the ability to mark To-Dos as completed and visually distinguish them.
Styling: Improve the application's appearance using CSS or a CSS framework.
